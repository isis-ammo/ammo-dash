Vanderbilt Dash
===============

Description
-----------

The Dash application (formerly QuickReports) allows the end-user to quickly create spotreport-like notices with attached media and broadcast them to other users via a subscription mechanism in the AMMO infrastructure.


Installation
------------

Please see the script install-reg-apks.sh located in Dropbox/Streak Config Files/Vanderbilt. Run the script from that location to install all Vanderbilt AMMO apps on a connected Android device.

-----
	Prerequisites
	------------------------
	Before using this appplication, please make 
	sure that the AmmoCore is started and is connected 
	to the Gateway service. Please see README in the
	"Vanderbilt Core" directory.

	Create a Report
	------------------------

	2. Optionally attach media by pressing one of the media buttons below the textbox.  The buttons will allow you to capture media (picture, video, audio) via medium-appropriate applications, and will return you to the main screen when done.
	3. Note that only one media item may be attached to each report.

	General Notes
	------------------------
	- Each dash report can contain one comment and one media item.
	- Timestamp and location are recorded at the time the report is posted.
	- The only form currently supported is MEDEVAC.
	- A browser is available to view all reports currently on the device (both received and queued reports). 
	- From the browser, media items attached to reports can be viewed by long-pressing on a report and then selecting the "Preview" option.
	- Selecting the Queue bar on the main screen will show all reports enqueued to the Gateway.
