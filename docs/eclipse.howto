To be productive in eclipse you will need the following:
- the m2eclipse eclipse plug-in
- construct named configurations with the following names and targets;
dash-parent : install
android-deploy : --projects dash package android:deploy

The first of these builds dashlib and installs it in your local repository.
The second builds dash and installs it on all attached devices.
